# HTML_in_tag_non-english_String-_reverser
This string reverser reverses every string in tags (i.e <a>Reverts this</a>) but does reverse Strings in which everything is ascii (not extended)(The example is incorrect but i needed to write this in english). This was used because the reverser does NOT reverse english! It is meant for me to reverse rtl languages so they will be read correctly in ltr format in xml files.


opening the file:
1. Unpack the zip
2. open the "main" folder
3. click on "main.exe"
4. Enter the file's path with quotation marks(i.e "d:/folder/file")
5. enter the file you want it to start from
6. enter the file you want it to stop at
7. check your file and if its not working post an issue in here. I will try to help you.
